# synulb
A new programming language


This language is not complete as it is in v0.1.


To make a proposal on how this programming language should be, (although that really wont do much right now,) create a pull request in the SUP repo. (https://github.com/Codeirie-YT/SynulbUpdateProposals)


You must run Installer.py when you first download Synulb. Everytime you change the file location it has to run too.
The Installer currently only works on windows.

To run a synulb program (after running Installer.py), simply run:

synulb <filename>

Or just type synulb and it will prompt you for the filename.

So far, only the hello world program works:

$setup:
;

$main:
    >console: "Hello, World!";
;
